## Trumpy Cat
Born out of an overwhelming appreciation for cat pictures and a strong amusement for Donald Trump's political campaign, this project should appeal to about 98% of the internet. Once the inspiration was ironed out, I decided none of the existing cat APIs of the world would be ideal for this vision, so I handpicked around 150 images to host my own API. The JSON data for that API can be referenced here:
http://trumpy-cat-api.herokuapp.com/cats

The Trump quotes are queried from a third party API â€“ the documentation for that can be found here: https://whatdoestrumpthink.com/api-docs/index.html

The app itself is hosted here: http://aubrey-northam.com/TrumpyCat

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JQuery, ReactJS, JSON, third-party API (see above), first-party API (using Ruby on Rails, Heroku), GitHub
